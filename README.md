# {LDWM Software(Leak Detection and Water Monitoring} - MAGNATHON
Our team has recognized a signoficant loss of non revenue water due to undetected leakages for this we have created a software that can be used to digitally :
-monitor water consumption
-detect and predict leaks
-shut off water flow

[Simulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14107l3dq3BFbNyRHQleXO5RHkfY3Nnso/view?usp=sharing)

## How it Works ?
IoT based sensors are used to monitor quantity,quality and sustainability of water.
The information gathered by the sensors will feed into a cloud based analytical platform. 

## Technologies used
Epanet,Wix,SQL server,Excel,IoT

## How to configure
Connect simulation with the website

## How to Run
Run the simulation using Epanet and use the output data then import it
into an sql server the data is then exported to the Website
